						This is the content of my blog post. It's really interesting because I only blog about super duper interesting stuff. If you'd like some examples, here's a list I've put together of former super duper interesting topics I've blogged about:
					</p>
						<ul>
							<li> super interesting topic 1 </li>
							<li> super interesting topic 2 </li>
							<li> super interesting topic 3 </li>
							<li> super interesting topic 4 </li>
						</ul>

						Crazy interesting huh? I know, I wrote about it! No one like to read that much though, so every now and again I throw in a picture of a cute fuzzy cat like this:

						Ain't that just the cutest ol' kitty ya ever done seen in your whole life?! But that's enough of that. Sometimes it's important to reflect on more important things. Deep things. Aldo Leopold is full of deep wisdom. Along with Douglas Adams, he's written some of my favorite quotes. <blockquote> "When I call to mind my earliest impressions, I wonder whether the process ordinarily referred to as growing up is not actually a process of growing down; whether experience, so much touted among adults as the thing children lack, is not actually a progressive dilution of the essentials by the trivialities of living." </blockquote> I mean, WOW! Talk about some deep shit! No, seriously, let's talk about it. Leave your comments below and join this deep mothafuckin discussion, ya hurd?
